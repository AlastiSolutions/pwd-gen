# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in this package, please report it to the project maintainers privately. You can use the following contact information:

- Email: security@alastisolutions.org

Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed and a fix has been released.

## Reporting Process

Once you have reported a vulnerability, the project maintainers will acknowledge your report and investigate it promptly. They will work together to understand the scope of the issue, prioritize it, and develop a plan to address it.

During the investigation, the project maintainers will:

- Confirm the vulnerability's existence.
- Determine the affected versions of the package.
- Assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- Prioritize the vulnerability based on its impact and the availability of a fix.

Once the vulnerability has been assessed and a plan has been developed, the project maintainers will:

- Work with you to understand the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Apply the necessary fixes to address the vulnerability.
- Test the fixes to ensure they have been successfully implemented.
- Release a new version of the package with the fixes.
- Communicate the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps to mitigate it to the affected users.

## Disclosure Policy

The project maintainers will disclose the vulnerability to the public as soon as a fix has been released and a reasonable amount of time has passed since the vulnerability was reported. This allows affected users to take appropriate action and mitigate the risk.

The disclosure will include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- The affected versions of the package.
- The steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The steps to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The release date of the fixed version of the package.

Thank you for helping to keep this package secure!
